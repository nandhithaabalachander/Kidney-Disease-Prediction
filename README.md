Technology has always been the foundation of the healthcare industry. However, what has changed in recent times against the backdrop of the pandemic outbreak, is the need to respond to unpredictable market changes quickly. The pandemic has acted as a catalyst for digital transformation. Digitalization in the healthcare industry enabled hospitals previously burdened with disparate legacy systems to simplify and standardise healthcare delivery systems. In doing so, healthcare businesses and millennial patients can reduce costs and improve the quality of care, all while leveraging leading-edge technologies.
AI and ML offer significant advantages over traditional analytics and clinical decision-making techniques

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
  Detecting & Removing missing values and outliers in the dataset and improve the accuracy using various algorithms and find the best-fit algorithm for increasing the accuracy score.
  
 <h2> METHODOLOGY</h2>
   
The Methodologies we used in this dataset are:
<li>Data Visualization</li>
<li>Data pre-processing â€“ Removing missing values and Outliers</li>
<li>Cleaning Data</li>
<li>Train Test split</li>
<li>Tune the Model for Higher Accuracy.</li>
<li>Random Forest Classifier</li>
<li>Support Vector Classifier</li>

<h2>RESULT</h2>
<li>Support Vector Classifier is best for achieving maximum accuracy for our dataset.</li>
<li>Accuracy score achieved = 0.64375 </li>
<li>The Accuracy of the Random Forest Classifier is Outfitted.</li>

<h2>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION </h2>
The Dataset was quite small with just 400 samples. isualising the distribution of data & their relationships, helped us to get some insights on the feature-set.
Testing multiple algorithms with default hyperparameters gave us some understanding for various models performance on this specific dataset.
It is safe to use the Support Vector Classifier algorithm.It performed better than other algorithms, as their scores were quite comparable & also they're more generalizable.
